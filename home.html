        <p class="hello-text">
          Hi! As you can see from the header, my name is Shalomeira Valencia
          Winata and you can simply call me Shalom. I was born and raised in
          Indonesia, specifically in a city called Surakarta. I am an 18 year
          old Taurean who loves to read contemporary fiction novels while
          listening to my Spotify playlist and binge-watch Netflix series and
          movies. I am currently studying Information System for Business in
          Ciputra University Surabaya. If you ask me how did I end up here, I
          would say that it was all fate. And I'll leave it at that :) <br />
          <br />
          I would consider myself as someone who is quiet introverted. I am not
          the kind of person who can easily initiate a conversation with someone
          new. But worry not, my introvertness does not limit myself to have an
          open mind. I tend to<span class="dots" id="dots">...</span>
          <span class="moreText" id="more">
            listen to others' perspectives on things before I decide what my
            thought on that particular topic/issue would be. Due to this, I am
            also open to experiencing new things. I would say organization is
            one of my strengths, though I do not keep a journal. I tend to at
            least plan ahead the day on my head and try to complete it all. When
            it comes to how I speak, I am pretty straight-forward. I consider
            this as something positive because this character of mine makes me
            have the courage to share my views/opinions with others.<br /><br />
            "No one is perfect," they say. "True that," I say. Like everybody
            else, I am still a work in progress. Despite being a second year
            university student, I am still sometimes struggling with time
            management. Due to my entertaining hobbies, I tend to procrastinate
            my work(s) which then leads to hectic final days (of submission)
            that caused me stress. I am also quite the perfectionist so, I tend
            to take longer time to make a decision. My perfectionism also
            results on me being quiet the overthinker because I always consider
            the 'what-ifs' and the worst possible thing to happen.<br /><br />
            When someone asks me, "What do you see yourself doing in the
            future?" I think I would reply it with a smile and change the
            subject (subtly) because I have actually been asking myself the same
            thing over and over again. I am still not sure what exactly is the
            thing that I want to pursue nor what my passion really is. All I
            know, is that I want to live happily and comfortably. I do always
            have a dream of living abroad, though. So to reach that point, I
            have thought about getting my master's degree in a university abroad
            (with scholarship) and maybe settle there. Or maybe I would have a
            decent job in technology (hopefully somewhere abroad) after getting
            my bachelor's degree. My skill in coding is not that good so, I
            think I prefer a job in analytics or maybe as a UI/UX designer. I am
            still struggling a lot with these IS stuff though. So, for the time
            being, I aim to really focus on school and try to excel at least one
            of the classes.
